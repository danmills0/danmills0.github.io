I am currently Research Scientist at [Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com/).
I am interested primarily in software driven techniques for extracting as much power from near term
quantum devices as possible. 

I completed my PhD in the [Pervasive
Parallelism centre for doctoral
training](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/cdt/pervasive-parallelism)
at the [University of Edinburgh School of
Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) under the supervision of
professor [Elham Kashefi](https://ekashefi.wordpress.com/), and as part of the
[quantum informatics group](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/quantum-informatics).

## Academic Interests

I am interested in benchmarking quantum devices, mitigating
errors arising in quantum processing units, classical simulation of quantum
computing, secure and distributed quantum computation, the theoretical
foundation of the potential for near term quantum computers to outperform
classical devices, and the use of software to optimally extract computational
power from such devices.

## Other Interests

I have a keen interest in science communication and journalism, having hosted my own science themed radio show on [Freshair](https://freshair.org.uk/), Edinburgh's student radio station, and having been head of news there. 

I'm also a keen maker and have worked in [the University of Edinburghâ€™s community makerspace](https://www.ucreatestudio.is.ed.ac.uk/) as a technician and marketing manager.

I, along with [Brian Coyle](https://briancoyle1.wixsite.com/briancoyle), organised [QuHackEd](https://quhackedinfo.wixsite.com/mysite), the first quantum computing hackathon in Scotland.
