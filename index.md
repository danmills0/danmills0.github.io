I am currently a PhD student in the [Pervasive Parallelism centre for doctoral training](http://pervasiveparallelism.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at the [University of Edinburgh School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics). Under the supervision of proffessor [Elham Kashefi](https://ekashefi.wordpress.com/), and as part of the [quantum informatics group](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/quantum-informatics), I study Quantum computation with a particular focus on verification of quantum computers and classical simulation of quantum systems.

You can find details about my experience at my [curriculum vitae]({{"/assets/CV.pdf"}}) while you may also wish to look over my [academic work](academic) or my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-mills) for further information.
