I am currently a PhD student in the [Pervasive Parallelism centre for doctoral training](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/cdt/pervasive-parallelism) at the [University of Edinburgh School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics). Under the supervision of professor [Elham Kashefi](https://ekashefi.wordpress.com/), and as part of the [quantum informatics group](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/quantum-informatics), I study Quantum computation.

## Academic Interests

The focus of my work is on the verification of near term quantum computers, where noise and architectural constraints are to be considered, and demonstrations of the superiority of quantum over classical computing. I also work on classical simulation of quantum systems, quantum cryptography, machine learning using quantum computers and on developing and utilising quantum software.

You can find details about my experience by following the links below:
* A collection of my [academic work](academic), as well as my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=qAAWFFEAAAAJ&gmla=AJsN-F7wChVI6DrBgGym427YKNkwejw6Amx94HpJZXsw9zXw8C83iaJ4m_yuKKl_QU8X6fq24hGu-ENWt9vRzQjEA6D50Z1Tjxm2-5f0TVWWs3WJ4WQVqAufHCLmddyJg_sXCozcOmyy) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/quant-ph?searchtype=author&query=Mills%2C+D) profiles, may be of interest
* My work experience can be found in my [curriculum vitae]({{"/assets/CV.pdf"}}) or in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-mills)

## Other Interests

I organised [QuHackEd](https://www.quhacked.com/), the first quantum computing hackathon in Scotland, and enjoy attending other such events.

I have a keen interest in science communication and journalism, having hosted my own science themed radio show on [Freshair](https://freshair.org.uk/), Edinburgh's student radio station, and having been head of news there. I'm also a keen maker and have worked in [the University of Edinburghâ€™s community makerspace](https://www.ucreatestudio.is.ed.ac.uk/) as a technician and marketing manager.
