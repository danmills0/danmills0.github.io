I am currently Research Scientist at [Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com/).
I am interested primarily in software driven techniques for extracting as much power from near term
quantum devices as possible. 

I completed my PhD in the [Pervasive Parallelism centre for doctoral
training](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/cdt/pervasive-parallelism)
at the [University of Edinburgh School of
Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) under the supervision of
professor [Elham Kashefi](https://ekashefi.wordpress.com/), and as part of the
[quantum informatics group](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/quantum-informatics).
I give a brief introduction to my work below.

## Academic Interests

I am interested in benchmarking quantum devices, mitigating
errors arising in quantum processing units, classical simulation of quantum
computing, secure and distributed quantum computation, the theoretical
foundation of the potential for near term quantum computers to outperform
classical devices, and the use of software to optimally extract computational
power from such devices.

You can find details about my experience by following the links below:
* A collection of my [academic work](academic), as well as my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=qAAWFFEAAAAJ&gmla=AJsN-F7wChVI6DrBgGym427YKNkwejw6Amx94HpJZXsw9zXw8C83iaJ4m_yuKKl_QU8X6fq24hGu-ENWt9vRzQjEA6D50Z1Tjxm2-5f0TVWWs3WJ4WQVqAufHCLmddyJg_sXCozcOmyy) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/quant-ph?searchtype=author&query=Mills%2C+D) profiles.
* My work experience can be found in my [curriculum vitae]({{"/assets/CV.pdf"}}) or in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-mills)

I have also contributed to the design and development of several open source software packages, including [Qermit](https://cqcl.github.io/Qermit/) and [pytket-dqc](https://cqcl.github.io/pytket-dqc/).

## Other Interests

I have a keen interest in science communication and journalism, having hosted my own science themed radio show on [Freshair](https://freshair.org.uk/), Edinburgh's student radio station, and having been head of news there. 

I'm also a keen maker and have worked in [the University of Edinburghâ€™s community makerspace](https://www.ucreatestudio.is.ed.ac.uk/) as a technician and marketing manager.

I, along with [Brian Coyle](https://briancoyle1.wixsite.com/briancoyle), organised [QuHackEd](https://quhackedinfo.wixsite.com/mysite), the first quantum computing hackathon in Scotland.

I also enjoy a selection of sports, in particular cycling, swimming, football, climbing and squash.
I'm happy to give you a game of pretty much anything though!
