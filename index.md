I am currently a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. Under the guidance of proffessor [Elham Kashefi](https://ekashefi.wordpress.com/) I study Quantum computation with a particular focus on verification of quantum computers and classical simulation of quantum systems.

You can find details about my experience at my [curriculum vitae]({{"/assets/CV.pdf"}}). You may also wish to look over my [academic work](academic) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-mills) for further information.
