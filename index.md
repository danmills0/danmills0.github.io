I am currently a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. Under the guidance of proffessor [Elham Kashefi](https://ekashefi.wordpress.com/) I study Quantum computation with a particular focus on verification of quantum computers and classical simulation of quantum systems.

You can find full details about my experience at my [curriculum vitae]({{"/assets/CV.pdf"}})
